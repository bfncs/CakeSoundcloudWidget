## Usage


### Controller

Include the helper in your Controller:

    <?php
    class MyController extends AppController {
      public $helpers = array('Soundcloud.SoundcloudWidget');
    }

### View

After including the helper in your controller, you can use it like this in your views:

    $this->Soundcloud->widget($url);

Where `$url` is a valid Soundcloud URL (i.e. `http://soundcloud.com/forss/flickermood`) of a song or a set.

Additionaly, you can add custom options for the current Player by passing an array iFrame options (as you would pass it as the third argument `$options` to the (`HtmlHelper::tag()`)[http://api20.cakephp.org/class/html-helper#method-HtmlHelpertag] function) as second argument and an array of [parameters for the player](http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/html5-widget#widget-params) as third argument:

    $this->Soundcloud->widget($url, array('width' => 640), array('show_artwork' => 'false'));
